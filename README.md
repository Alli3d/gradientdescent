# GradientDescent
Visualiser tool for gradient descent. Program takes (preset) x and y coords then uses manual cost function (MSE) to find the m, b attributes of y = mx + b.

Every 100th iteration is printed to stdout.
Every 1000th iteration is plotted with mathplotlib in blue. The real y = mx + b plot is shown in red.
